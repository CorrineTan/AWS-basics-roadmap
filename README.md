# AWS-basics-roadmap
Corrine Tan's Personal learning road map of AWS Basic Knowledge

> Note: By the time I create this repo, I have already got CLP, SAA and SAP certs. So the order will be different from the complete new beginners.

### Step 0: [Basics: SAA and SAP](https://github.com/CorrineTan/AWS-basics-roadmap/tree/main/aws-basic)  

Although I've finished CLP, SAA and SAP, I'm using this folder to record something important and confusing.

### Step 1: [AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialty](https://github.com/CorrineTan/AWS-basics-roadmap/tree/main/das)  

Preparing for the DAS exam and summary of the important knowledge I learn from Udemy Course https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-data-analytics/
